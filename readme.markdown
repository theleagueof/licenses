==================================================

The Open Font License (OFL), is a license we like here at The League of Moveable Type, because it’s the only open-source license specifically designed for fonts.
It may seem a bit like legalese (and it sort of is – one of the goals of it’s creators was to make sure the license was legally sound), it has an answer to almost all the questions you can imagine for an open-source font.

In order to make it slightly more readable, and a little less overwhelming, we’ve converted it to Markdown. We’ve paid special attention to the formatting Github uses, too.

Now go read!
